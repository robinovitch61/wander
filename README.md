`wander` currently supports viewing jobs, allocations, tasks, and logs across a Nomad cluster.

It is written with the [Bubble Tea TUI framework from Charm](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), and is in
active development. Expect near term improvements. Feature requests in the form of issues are welcome.

## Installation

With [Go installed on your machine](https://go.dev/doc/install), install `wander` with

```shell
go install github.com/robinovitch61/wander@latest
```

Alternatively, clone this repo, build from source with `cd <cloned_repo> && go build`
, then move the binary to somewhere accessible in your `PATH`, e.g. `mv ./wander /usr/local/bin`.

## Usage

Run the app by running `wander` in a terminal. See `wander --help` and config section below for details.

## Configuration

`wander` can be configured in a yaml file at `$HOME/.wander.yaml` or a file path passed to the `--config` argument.

Example yaml file:

```shell
# required: nomad address
wander_addr: http://localhost:4646

# required: nomad token
wander_token: nomad_token

# only relevant for `wander serve` - the host of the machine serving the ssh app
wander_host: localhost

# only relevant for `wander serve` - the port of the ssh app
wander_port: 22
```

Alternatively, `wander` can be configured via environment variables (e.g. `wander_addr` in yaml above becomes the
WANDER_ADDR environment variable), or via command line args visible by running `wander --help`.

## Trying It Out

You can try `wander` out by running a local nomad cluster in dev mode
following [these instructions](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/get-started-run?in=nomad/get-started):

```sh
# in first terminal session, start and leave nomad running in dev mode
sudo nomad agent -dev -bind 0.0.0.0 -log-level INFO

# in a different terminal session, create example job and run it
nomad job init
nomad job run example.nomad

# run wander
NOMAD_ADDR=http://localhost:4646 NOMAD_TOKEN="blank" wander
```

## SSH App

`wander` can be served via ssh application. For example, you could host an internal ssh application for your company
such that anyone on the internal network can `ssh -p <your-port> <your-host>` and immediately use `wander` without
installing anything.

Optionally, users can pass their token in with `ssh -p <port> <host> -t <token>`. The `-t` argument does not stand for
token - it forces `ssh` to allocate a pty.

Serve the ssh app with `wander serve`.

## Development

The `scripts/dev.sh` script watches the source code and rebuilds the app on changes
using [entr](https://github.com/eradman/entr).

`wander` runs the built app. You must rerun it on rebuild.

If the `WANDER_DEBUG` environment variable is set to `true`, the `dev.Debug(s string)` function outputs logs
to `wander.log`.
